<h2>Cryptography Defined/Brief History</h2>
<p>If you want to keep information secret, you have two possible 
strategies: hide the existence of the information, or make the 
information unintelligible. Cryptography is the art and science of 
keeping information secure from unintended audiences, of encrypting it. 
Conversely, cryptanalysis is the art and science of breaking encoded 
data. The branch of mathematics encompassing both cryptography and 
cryptanalysis is cryptology.</p>

<p>Modern cryptography uses sophisticated mathematical equations (algorithms) and secret keys to encrypt and decrypt data.<br>

<p>Today, cryptography is used to provide secrecy and integrity to our 
data, and both authentication and anonymity to our communications.</p>

<h3>Modern Historical Overview</h3>
<p>Cryptology was a public field in the United States until World War I,
 when the Army &amp; Navy realized its value to national security and 
began working in secret. Through the early 1970s, cryptology was 
dominated by the government both because computers were very expensive 
and because the government released very little information. It returned
 to mainstream academic and scientific communities in a sort of 
cryptology renaissance when the computer revolution made computers more 
readily available and when demand for encryption increased due to 
fundamental changes in the ways America communicated. </p>

<p>The increase in demand for cryptography was driven by industry 
interest (e.g., financial services required secure electronic 
transactions and businesses needed to secure trade secrets stored on 
computers), and individual interest (e.g., secure wireless 
communications). Digital communications were obvious candidates for 
encryption.</p>

<h3>Principles of Modern Cryptography</h3>
<p>Modern cryptographers emphasize that security should not depend on 
the secrecy of the encryption method (or algorithm), only the secrecy of
 the keys.  The secret keys must not be revealed when plaintext and 
ciphertext are compared, and no person should have knowledge of the key.
 Modern algorithms are based on mathematically difficult problems -  for
 example, prime number factorization, discrete logarithms, etc. There is
 no mathematical proof that these problems are in fact are hard, just 
empirical evidence. </p>

<p>Modern cryptographic algorithms are too complex to be executed by 
humans. Today's algorithms are executed by computers or specialized 
hardware devices, and in most cases are implemented in computer 
software. </p>

<p>The design of secure systems using encryption techniques focuses 
mainly on the protection of (secret) keys.  Keys can be protected either
 by encrypting them under other keys or by protecting them physically, 
while the algorithm used to encrypt the data is made public and 
subjected to intense scrutiny. When cryptographers hit on an effective 
method of encryption (a cipher), they can patent it as intellectual 
property and earn royalties when their method is used in commercial 
products. In the current open environment, many good cryptographic 
algorithms are available in major bookstores, libraries and on the 
Internet, or patent office. </p>

<h3>Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms</h3>
<p>There are two types of key-based encryption, symmetric (or 
secret-key) and asymmetric (or public-key) algorithms. Symmetric 
algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption (or the 
decryption key is easily derived from the encryption key), while 
asymmetric algorithms use a different key for encryption and decryption,
 and the decryption key cannot be derived from the encryption key. </p>

<p>Symmetric algorithms can be divided into stream ciphers and block 
ciphers. Stream ciphers can encrypt a single bit of plaintext at a time,
 whereas block ciphers take a number of bits (typically 64 bits in 
modern ciphers), and encrypt them as a single unit. An example of a 
symmetric algorithm is DES.<br>

<p>Asymmetric ciphers (also called public-key cryptography) make a 
public key universally available, while only one individual possesses 
the private key. When data is encrypted with the public key, it can only
 be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. Public key 
cryptography adds a very significant benefit - it can serve to 
authenticate a source (e.g. a digital signature). Public key 
cryptography was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 
1975. An example of an asymmetric algorithm is RSA.<br>

<p>In general, symmetric algorithms execute much faster than asymmetric 
ones. In real applications, they are often used together, with a 
public-key algorithm encrypting a randomly generated encryption key, 
while the random key encrypts the actual message using a symmetric 
algorithm. This combination is commonly referred to as a digital 
envelope.</p>
